# JavaScript

JavaScript **cannot** be converted to WebAssembly, however
[Javy](https://github.com/Shopify/javy) can execute JavaScript code in a
WebAssembly embedded JavaScript runtime, powered by the
[QuickJS embedded JavaScript engine](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs).

## Current State

Currently there's no Kubewarden SDK for JavaScript. As of the time of writing,
Javy is a beta project that was only recently released.
